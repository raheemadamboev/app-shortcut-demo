## Notes

1. Static shortcut creates instance of activity every time it's clicked. Multiple target activities is not created but target activity always gets recreated. `onNewIntent()` is not called when target activity is on the current stack and app is started from static action even though activity's `launchMode` is set properly. Instead use dynamic or pinned shortcut if you need `onNewIntent()` usage.
2. Static shortcuts can't be disabled or removed dynamically. The app crashes if you try to do so.
3. Pinned shortcut isn't included in shortcut list when icon is long clicked.
